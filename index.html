        is a geometric sans serif typeface designed by Paul Renner released in
        1927 by the Bauer Type Foundry. Futura is based on geometric shapes like
        the circle, triangle and squares with restrained optical adjustments.
        The geometric shapes make this font feel symmetrical, modular,
        industrial, and modern. All letter forms use the same uniform line
        weight with minimal contrast. The capital letters have similar
        proportions to roman square capitals. Unlike other sans serif typefaces
        at the time, futura had a relatively low x-height, making it one of the
        first to be suitable for body copy. Futura is one of the most popular
        fonts of the twentieth century.
