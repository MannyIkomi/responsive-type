# Responsive Typography
 
As part of my transition from print to user interface I experimented with recreating my type posters and documents. The objective was to re-imagine my static design as a fluid, interactive web page. Along the way I began incorporating, animation, typographic features, and new CSS Grid layout methods. My approach was inspired by a series of projects by [Jen Simmons](https://labs.jensimmons.com/).
